He was very\nfond of hunting. He was a famous hunter in the kingdom. There was no one to beat him\nin hunting in his country.\n\nThe King had a loyal and intelligent pet Falcon. He took the falcon wherever he went\nfor hunting. On one such hunting expedition, the falcon sat on the king\'s shoulder when\nhe rode into the thick forest. The servants also rode behind him watching the falcon\nseriously.\nAt a place he stopped and watched very curiously. He heard a strange noise. There he saw a gazelle and said \xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful it is!" \nHe was very much attracted by the its gracefull walk and the long, slender antlers. Suddenly he took his bow and arrow and aimed at the animal. But the animal quickly\nsped away from that place. The King and the servants chased it into the forest. But the\nanimal dodged them to escape. It sprang between the trees and bushes and ran away\ninto the thick forest.\nBut when the king continued his chasing, the servants could not follow him and stayed back. The king was isolated from his servants with his horse and falcon. The evening came. The King felt very tired and he was also thirsty. \nHe cried \xe2\x80\x9cWater! Water please!" \nHe moved here and there in search of water. He lost his way also.\nFinally he came near a pond with little water. He quickly took his jar and filled it with\nwater. As he was exhausted very much he brought the jar near his mouth, the falcon\nflapped its wings. The wings, which flung near the jar made the jar to slip and the water\nflowed out to the ground. \nHe cried\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do?" can\xe2\x80\x99t you know, I am thirsty now!"\nThe King patiently bent down and refilled his jar with water to drink. When he tried again to drink the falcon again fluttered and spilled the water in the ground. Now the King got angry and said," Are you mad! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know my thirst? But the falcon continued its flapping around the king. So he thought that the falcon was an ungrateful bird. So he drew out his sward from the cover to kill the falcon. \nBut the falcon screamed and looked at the king. The King felt that the bird wanted to tell\nsomething.\nSo the king looked up and, there he saw some poisonous snakes on the branches of the\ntree. Then he knew that the water in the pond was full of poison dropping from the mouth of snakes. If the King drank the water he would be dead. But the falcon prevented its master from drinking the poisonous water.\nSo the King realized that the faithful falcon had saved his life. So he smiled at the bird \nand murmured, \xe2\x80\x9c You are my good friend." \nIt also felt glad that his master understood its\' good intention.\n Falcon saved His Friend The King : \n  \n  Falcon saved His Friend The King To HOME PAGE \n  Idioms Index \xe2\x80\x93 Previous Page \n      \n     \n\nPopular Pages\nHome\n\nreport this ad\n\nMore Info\n\nRelated Links : Falcon saved His Friend The King\n\nreport this ad\n\nSearch\n\n  \n\nNavigation\n\nConfused WordsWhat is NEW?Nursery RhymesBeauties of EnglishTop Menu\n\nFollow Us\nTwitter\nFacebook\n\xc2\xa9 english-for-students.com.
