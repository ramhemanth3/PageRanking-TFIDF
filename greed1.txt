He was very rich, but he was very greedy. One day he loaded his forty camels with costly spices to sell in a far away city in Arabia. He sold all the spices there. He halted in an inn to have lunch on the way back. There a Holy man met Abdullah and they became friends then.\nThe Holy man described about the secret land of enormous wealth. \n"I also have heard about it \xe2\x80\x9c Abdullah said with a smile. \nThe Holy man said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you bring your camels there, we will load a lot of precious stones like diamonds, rubies and gold." Abdullah nodded his head as a symbol of acceptance. The Holy man further said that half of the load should be given to him. Abdullah thought that it was reasonable. So he agreed the offer.\nBoth of them travelled and reached the land fully surrounded by beautiful mountains. The Holy man sprinkled some white powder on the ground, taken from a small box he had. Suddenly clouds of smoke came from the powder. After, all the smoke had settled down,\nhe saw a way there. When both of them went through the path they found a cave with full\nof gems and gold coins.\nThe Holy man asked Abdullah to come in. He moved inside the cave. There he saw the treasure which he never had seen before. He quickly took them and filled his bags and loaded them on the camels. When he completed the loading of all the forty camels, the Holy man told Abdullah that he should take twenty camels, as his share.\nOn hearing that Abdullah said to the Holy man, \xe2\x80\x9c why are you in need of such a wealth?,\nyou may take only ten. I will take thirty". \nThe Holy man agreed to that with a smile. Some time later, the greedy Abdullah again said, \xe2\x80\x9cEven the ten would be a burden to a Holy man like you, so you may take five only". \nAgain the Holy man agreed. But Abdullah was not satisfied with that. So he asked him to give the five also to him. The Holy man nodded his head with a smile.\nEven then Abdullah was not satisfied. So he again asked him to give the magical powder\ntoo as the Holy man needed it no more. Only then the holy man warned Abdullah that the\npowder might cause danger if it was not used properly. \nFurther he said that it turned everything to gold when rubbed on the left eye. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you would be blind if you rubbed it on your right eye\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99he said.\nAs his greed grew more, Abdullah did not care about the danger. He compelled the holy man to give the powder. After a while the holy man gave the magical powder with\nthe box and left the place.\nAbdullah could not control his curiosity. He quickly started to rub some powder on his left eye. All of a sudden the entire thing which he saw with his left eye changed into gold. Then he thought that if he rubbed the powder on both the eyes, the whole world would turn as gold.\nIgnoring the warning of the Holy man, he rubbed the powder on his right eye also. At\nthe very next movement he became blind. He cried with pain and said,"God\xe2\x80\xa6I was too\ngreedy". But it was too late, for he had become totally blind.\n Greediness can make A Man Blind : \n  \n  Greediness can make A Man Blind To HOME PAGE \n  Idioms Index \xe2\x80\x93 Previous Page \n   \n Related Links : Greediness can make A Man Blind \n        \n     report this ad\nPrivacy Policy\nSearch website\n  \nreport this ad\nSHARE\nTweet\nADDITIONAL INFO\nreport this ad\nx\n'
